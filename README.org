#+TITLE: TOGoS's OpenSCAD designs

** Testing / Automation

As of [2023-07-09], `test.bat` will use `find` (location specified by `%UNIX_FIND_EXE%`)
to find all `.scad` files and attempt to evaluate them.

A nicer system would cache results and pass in every defined preset for each OpenSCAD design.

STLs and renders can be generated from the command-line, like

#+begin_src bat
"C:\Program Files\OpenSCAD\openscad.com" -p 2023\togridpile\TGx9.4.json -P p1706 --render 2023\togridpile\TGx9.4.scad -o output/p1706.1536x1536.png -o output/p1706.stl --colorscheme "Tomorrow Night" --imgsize 1536,1536
#+end_src

*** [2023-07-09] Thoughts on improved testing system

Process (may be pipelined, unix-style, if you want):

- List files (basically 'find')
- Hash files, list out filename + hash ('ccouch3 id -show-inputs' may already do this!)
- Parse files, list dependencies
- Recursively generate hashes for each file based on hash + hash of dependencies

#+TITLE: TOGoS's OpenSCAD designs

** Testing

As of [2023-07-09], `test.bat` will use `find` (location specified by `%UNIX_FIND_EXE%`)
to find all `.scad` files and attempt to evaluate them.

A nicer system would cache results and pass in every defined preset for each OpenSCAD design.
For some reason I decided to use Janet for that system.
It is in progress and not yet functional.

*** [2023-07-09] Thoughts on improved testing system

Principles:
- Unix-style: Small programs that operate on text streams

Parts:
- List files (basically 'find')
- Hash files, list out filename + hash ('ccouch3 id -show-inputs' may already do this!)

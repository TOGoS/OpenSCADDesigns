#+TITLE: TOGoS's OpenSCAD designs

** Testing

As of [2023-07-09], `test.bat` will use `find` (location specified by `%UNIX_FIND_EXE%`)
to find all `.scad` files and attempt to evaluate them.

A nicer system would cache results and pass in every defined preset for each OpenSCAD design.
For some reason I decided to use Janet for that system.
It is in progress and not yet functional.
